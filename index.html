                    Hello! My name is Bryan Costa, and I am in a Coding Bootcamp looking to grow my knowledge in the
                    field of web
                    development. I currently work for Left Brain Logistics and being that our entire business is driven
                    by technology
                    and software, my boss felt the need to find someone who is able to develope applications in order to
                    help us grow as
                    a business.
                </p> 
                <p id="p1">
                    I showed interested in the field and my boss has since help me to go back to school to
                    learn web
                    development. Based on what I have learned so far in the class, I am already seeing different
                    application to my job
                    currently and I am looking forward to continuing to find ways to take what I am learning and use it
                    to help the
                    company grow.
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="col-">
            <p id="p2">
                My friends and family tend to describe me as a laid back person who is willing to go with the flow.
                Over the years,
                I found that I tendency to be a good listener and someone whom people can come to when they need a
                person to vent
                to. This actually has helped me in my job, because as people have been venting to me I have been
                able to understand
                better what exactly the challenges that my coworkers are facing when it comes to technology and come
                up with better
                solutions that meet their specific needs. I find this particularly rewarding since it allows me to
                blend and use
                both my undergraduate education in Psychology and my current studies in web development.
